1. Add a new type of object that can be collide with users. Similiar to pickup, however, this new type of object, wrongone, will decrease player's score if collided with player. The corresponded change of script is playerController.
2. Add a sprint ability to player. The playerController script is edited to accomplish this function. Player can sprint by holding key shift. The speed is twice than without sprint.
3. Change the win state to 10 and clear all possible remainning objects, such as pickup or wrongone, when win state is reached. The corresponded change of script is playercontroller.
