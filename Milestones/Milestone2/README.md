Milestone2: Physics Simulation

This project aims to let student to create a number of physics objects and explore some programmatic control of the physics simulation.
(rigidbodies, collision events, physics layers,Compound Collider for Complex Geometry, Chain with Joint Constraints, Mecanim-Animated Kinematic Elevator,Customized Center of Mass,etc)
