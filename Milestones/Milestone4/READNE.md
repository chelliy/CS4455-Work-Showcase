Milestone 4 – Artificial Intelligence

Let one minion to be AI-controlled and run around a waypoint loop. Used Unity’s NavMeshAgent to control the steering behaviors. Implemented a basic state machine to instruct the NavMeshAgent what to do. The minion will use position prediction to intercept a sixth 
waypoint.
